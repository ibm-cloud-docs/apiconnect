# Logging for API Connect V10 Reserved 
{: #ri-logs}

{{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_full}} V10 Reserved exposes platform logs that you can monitor with the IBM Log Analysis service. API Connect will automatically start sending platform logs to a Log Analysis service configured in the same location.
{: shortdesc}

To monitor the logs for V10 Reserved, you must configure a logging instance in a region. For information, see [Configuring IBM Cloud platform logs](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs).
