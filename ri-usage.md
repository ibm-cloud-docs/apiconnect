# Reviewing your plan and usage
{: #ri-usage}

You can review information about your {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} Reserved plan and API use. The information lets you track overall usage against your plan, and displays a graph showing your monthly usage rate.
{: shortdesc}

By reviewing your usage, you can determine whether your current plan provides for a sufficient number of API calls. If your usage looks like it will exceed your allowed number of calls, you can contact IBM Sales to upgrade the plan.

On the administration console's home page, click **Plan and usage** in the navigation list.

The following information displays for the current Reserved service plan and its usage levels:

- Current plan: The name of the purchase plan for your service, the start and end dates of the subscription, and the maximum allowed number of API calls for the plan period.

- Usage information: The cumulative number of API calls to date, and the projected number of calls for the whole subscription period. If you have exceeded your plan maximum or are approaching that limit, an indicator displays with the value.

- Version information: The current version level for your Reserved service instance. If an upgrade is available, information about the new version and the upgrade period display. Click ** Schedule upgrade** to schedule your service upgrade. For information about upgrading, see [Upgrading your Reserved service](/docs/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-ri-upgrade).

- API calls per month: a graph showing the number of API calls for each month in the subscription period. Hover over the bar for a particular month to see the time period and API usage. Hover over the dotted line to see the average monthly usage from the start of the subscription period through the current date.
