# Reviewing your plan and usage

{: #ri-usage}

You can review information about your {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} Reserved plan and API use. The information lets you track overall usage against your plan, and displays a graph showing your monthly usage rate.
{: shortdesc}

Reviewing your subscription start and end dates helps you plan renewal cycles and subscription extensions.

Reviewing your API usage, help you determine whether your current plan provides for a sufficient number of API calls. If your usage looks like it will exceed your allowed number of calls, you can contact IBM Sales to upgrade the plan before you exceed the limit and sustain overage charges. You can also view your historical API usage data on a monthly basis, so that you can see trends and usage spikes when planning future subscription volumes.

On the administration console's home page, click **Plan and usage** in the navigation list.

The following information displays for the current Reserved service plan and its usage levels:

- Current plan: The name of the purchase plan for your service, the start and end dates of the subscription, and the maximum allowed number of API calls for the plan period. If you have exceeded your plan maximum or are approaching that limit, a message displays with details.

- Cumulative usage: The total number of API calls to date.

- Projected annual usage: The expected yearly API usage, which is calculated on the basis of daily usage.

- API call usage per month: A graph showing the number of API calls for each month in the subscription period. Hover over the bar for a particular month to see the time period and API usage. Hover over the dotted line to see the average monthly usage from the start of the subscription period through the current date.
