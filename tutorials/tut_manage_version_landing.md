# Managing API and Product versions in API Connect V5
{: #tut_manage_version_landing}

After publishing an API and the product that contains it, API providers typically need to update those products and APIs. Updating an API product can happen in different ways; for example:  

- Completely replace the old API product with a new version, automatically updating all subscriptions.
- Supersede the old API product with the new version, manually updating individual subscriptions.

To replace an API, take the API product out of service and then remove it by completing the following tasks:

- **Deprecate the API product**: Prevent new subscriptions to the API but do not prohibit usage.
- **Retire the API product**: Prevents any use of the API but do not remove it.
- **Archive the API product**: Remove the API from use but do not delete it completely. The API can be can be reinstated if needed.
- **Delete the API product**: Permanently delete API product.
