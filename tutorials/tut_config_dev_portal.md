## Create your developer portal
{: #create_prereq_tut_config_dev_portal}

In this section, you will create a developer portal for a catalog.

*Catalogs* are an IBM term for different environments. For example, you would create different catalogs for your testing, staging, and production enviornments. You should have a catalog called Sandbox. Feel free to use this catalog to create your developer portal, or create a new catalog and name it whatever you want.

1. In your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard, select your **API Connect** service to launch the {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} dashboard.
