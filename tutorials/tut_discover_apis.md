# Discovering APIs
{: #tut_discover_apis}

**Duration**: 25 mins  
**Skill level**: Beginner  

## Objective
{: #object_tut_discover_apis}

In this tutorial, you will learn how a portal user might consume the APIs in the {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_full}} V5 Developer Portal. You will gain an understanding of how a portal user would explore products and APIs, view and test APIs, and subscribe to APIs. 

## Prerequisite
{: #prereq_tut_discover_apis}

There is no prerequisite for this tutorial. As a portal administrator, you can also complete this tutorial while you navigate your developer portal to experience how your portal users navigate your developer portal. Keep in mind that all developer portals have different skins. 

If you do not have an existing developer portal, you can set up and configure a developer portal in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} before proceeding with this tutorial.

## Explore Products & APIs
