In this tutorial, you verify your access to {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}, then open the API Manager and create an API. Ready to get started? 

## Log in to {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} with your provider organization
{: #open-apim_getting-started}

To use the API Manager, you must be invited to a provider organization in {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}. An administrator from your company creates the provider organization, defines access settings, and then adds users.

You can log into the {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} with your provider organization by completing the following steps:

1. [Log in](https://cloud.ibm.com/login/){: external} to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} using your IBM ID.

2. On the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard, click ![Menu icon](images/icon_cloud_menu.png "Menu icon") and select **API Management**.

3. In the navigation list, expand **API Connect** and click **Services**.

4. On the Services page, display the provider organizations for your company's {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} Reserved service by expanding the row that displays the service name. Your administrator can tell you which provider organization you belong to.

   Provider organizations belong to Reserved instances, so you need to expand your Reserved instance to see the list of associated provider organizations. Each provider organization is labelled as "Provider Organization" in the "Plan" column. If your company has multiple Reserved instances and you don't know which one to use, just expand each one until you see your provider organization.

5. Click the name of a provider organization to start the {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} API Manager.

   Your administrator can tell you which provider organization you belong to if it's not clear to you. When you click the provider organization to start API Manager, you are automatically logged in.

   If you belong to multiple provider organizations and want to log in with a different one, log out of API Manager. Then, return to the {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} Services page and log in with another provider organization.

   Whenever you want to work in API Manager, return to the Services page and select your provider organization. 

When you see the {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} Home page, you're ready to proceed.
