# Socializing your APIs with the Developer Portal
{: #ri-portal}

In each provider organization, a Product Manager sets up a customized Developer Portal where APIs and products can be shared with consumers.
{: shortdesc}

In addition to helping application developers find and use your APIs, the Developer Portal provides features such as API analytics, forums, blogs, and rating facilities.

For a quick start in setting up your developer portal, see the [Developer Portal tutorials](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMNED_v10cloud/com.ibm.apic.devportal.doc/tutorials_devportal_home.html){: external}. To learn more about configuring and managing a Developer Portal in {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}, start with the following topics in the extended V10 Reserved documentation:

## Setting up a developer portal
{: #config_ri-portal}

The person who enables a developer portal for their provider organization automatically receives administrator access to that portal. The portal admin (typically a Product Manager for the provider organization) can manage the portal by adding users, customizing the portal's appearance, setting up forums, and viewing reports on portal performance. For information on setting up a developer portal, see [Configuring your developer portal](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMNED_v10cloud/com.ibm.apic.devportal.doc/capim_devportal_admin.htm){: external}

The portal administrator does not receive admin access to the {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} Reserved instance.
