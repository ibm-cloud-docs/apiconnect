# Viewing API event analytics

{: #ri-analytics}

The Product Manager uses the Analytics feature to track API usage and performance, which helps determine when APIs should be updated or retired.
{: shortdesc}

When you view analytics data in the API Manager, you see metrics about the APIs that your provider organization developed and shared with customers. Information is collated from API events, which occur each time an API is invoked by a consumer application. The ability to visualize API analytics in different styles and combinations helps you understand how your APIs are used. You can use this insight when you need to make decisions about which APIs to offer, determine when to replace or retire an API, and understand who is consuming your APIs.
