**Plans (Based on V5 of API Connect):**
- Lite, Enterprise Paygo, Enterprise 25M 
- Essential, Enterprise 1B, Professional Paygo, Professional 5M, Professional 25M 


**Timeline:**
Current provisioned instances of the service will be End of Support on July 31, 2023.  After July 31, 2023 the service will no longer be available to users.  This provides time to plan and execute a migration to an alternative option. Users data will be available for migration until the End of Support date.  


**Options available to evaluate:**
- Option 1: [API Connect Reserved Plan](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10_reserved_instance){: external}. This is a single-tenant solution based on API Connect V10, hosted on IBM Cloud with an annual subscription. 
- Option 2: [API Connect Software](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10.0.5.x_lts?topic=api-connect-overview){: external}. This is a software solution that you deploy yourself with choice and flexibility in deployment.  For example, it can be deployed on IBM Cloud Kubernetes service (IKS) or RedHat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.  Simple software pricing based on API Calls is available.
