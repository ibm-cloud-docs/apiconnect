# Managing APIs
{: #managing_apis}

Managing your APIs allows you to control usage, increase adoption and track statistics in the Lite, Enterprise, and Hybrid plans.
{: shortdesc}

You can use API Connect to manage APIs in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, whether they are hosted in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} or maintained outside of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 

If you are a customer, you can manage how it is used within the API Manager UI after a developer creates an API and pushes the product to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The following topics describe how to create and manage products within {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}.

## Exposing on-premises APIs through a Secure Gateway
{: #expose_apis_sec_gate-managing_apis}

IBM Cloud Secure Gateway is deprecated and replaced with [IBM Cloud Satellite](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/satellite){: external}. For more information, see the [IBM Cloud Secure Gateway Deprecation](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-cloud-secure-gateway-deprecation){: external} notice.
{: note}

You can create a secure gateway to securely expose on-premises APIs to {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_full}}.

When you create a secure gateway and then provide a target address for its client or Cloud `<host>:<port>`, you integrate the features of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} service with {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}. This means that you have a secure way to access your on-premises APIs from {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} through a secure passage. Effectively you create a tunnel to {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} on a public environment without exposing your on-premises data. All that you need to do is create and configure the secure gateway service on IBM Cloud and provide an address for it in an API.

For more information about the {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} service, and how to set it up, see [About {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}}](/docs/SecureGateway?topic=securegateway-getting-started-with-sg){: external}.

### Using the secure gateway with your APIs
{: #using_sec_gate_apis-managing_apis notoc}

When you have configured the gateway, you can use it with your APIs.
{: shortdesc}

To use your secure gateway with APIs, complete the following steps.

1. Create your API and Product. 
   When you create the API, be sure to select the **Add a Product** option to create a new Product at the same time. 
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Do not publish the Product yet.

   The API is displayed in the `Design` View.
  
2. Click **Assemble**.

3. Click the **Invoke** policy to open the **Invoke** palette.

   **RESTRICTION**: Logic switches (for example, `Switch`, `Operation Switch`, and `If`) cannot be used with APIs that use a secure gateway.

4. **IMPORTANT**: Do not select the **Access URL through Secure Gateway** check box.

   This check box is for a deprecated feature that is not supported for production and is subject to removal at any time. Instead, you will provide an address for the Secure Gateway URL directly in the next step.

5. In the **URL** field, update the target-url with the Cloud host name and port number, as in: _Cloud-host:Port_, where the cloud host will be the Secure Gateway server specified in the secure gateway service, and the port will be assigned once you create the destination. For example: 
```
cap-sg-prd-5.securegateway.appdomain.cloud:18579
```

6. Click **Save![Save icon](images/icon_save.png "Save icon").

7. Click **All APIs** > **Products** and select the Product that you created earlier.

8. Click **Publish** to stage the Product to a selected Catalog.

9. Select the Catalog that you want to use.

10. Select the staged Product.

11. Click **Publish**.

You have securely exposed your on-premises API to {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}. Next, test your {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} API.

### Testing your secure gateway API
{: test_sec_gate-managing_apis notoc}

After you have provided an address for the {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} in an API, you can test the API to ensure that the gateway is working and that it produces the correct response.

To test an API using the secure gateway, complete the following steps:

1. Click ![Navigate icon](<images/navigate_to_icon.png "Navigate icon") > **Drafts** > **APIs** > **_Your-API_** > **Assemble**.

2. Click ![Test icon](images/test_icon.png "Test icon").

3. Select a Catalog to test within from the list provided.

4. Ensure the URL provides an address for the correct Secure Gateway `<cloud_host>:<port>` and that the secure gateway service desitination has been correctly configured as described in the [{{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}}](/docs/SecureGateway?topic=securegateway-getting-started-with-sg){: external} documentation.

5. Choose an existing Product from the list that is provided then click **Republish
product**.

   **Important** If this Product is already published to a Catalog, this task will republish the Product with the new gateway.

6. **Optional**: Provide a name to create a new Product then click **Create and publish**.

7. Click **Next**.

8. Select an operation to invoke from the list provided.

9. Click **Invoke**.

   The test results are displayed.

## Staging and publishing a LoopBack application
{: #stage_publish_lb_app-managing_apis}

1. In the navigation list of the API Designer, click **Products**.
   The Products tab opens.

2. Select the version of the Product that you want to work with.

3. To publish the run time to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, click **Publish**.

4. Click **Add and Manage Targets** > **Add IBM Cloud target**.

5. Select the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} **Region** that you want to publish to and sign in.

6. Select the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} **Organization** that you want to publish to.

7. A list of Catalogs is displayed. Select the Catalog that you want to publish to.

8. Click **Next**.

9. Select the LoopBack application that you want to publish.
   If this is the first time that you are deploying the run time to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, add a name and click the **Add** icon.

10. Click **Save**.

11. Click **Publish** again and select **Publish application**.

12. Click **Publish**.

13. In the command line, the API Target URL and API invoke tls-profile is specified for the API.
    Make a note of this information. The API invoke tls-profile is always `client:Loopback-client`, but you can retrieve the API Target URL as described in the following step.
    ```
    Deploying to IBM Cloud
    ...preparing project
    ...building package for deploy
    ...uploading package
    Runtime published successfully.
    Management URL: https://<domain name>/apps/33e7b062-092b-4227-af97-047499dab2e7
    API target urls: apiconnect-33e7b062-092b-4227-af97-047499dab2e7.<IBM_Cloud_org>-<IBM_Cloud_space>.apic.<domain_name>
    API invoke tls-profile: client:Loopback-client
    Updated newapi_1.0.0.yaml with tls-profile and target-url.
    Updated notes.yaml with tls-profile and target-url.
    ```

14. In the API Designer UI, complete the following steps:
    1. Click **APIs**.
    2. Select your API.
    3. Click **Assemble**.
    4. In the Assembly editor, click the **Filter policies** icon.
    5. Select **DataPower Gateway policies**.
    6. Click **Save** to save the API.

15. Next, you need to publish to the API Manager. Click **Publish**.
    1. Select **Publish application** then choose one of the following options:
	     - **Replace existing app**: If you have a published application, select this option to overwrite the existing app.
        - **As a brand new app (using the existing route)**: Select this option to create a new app and provide a name for it in the **New app** field. The service is not interrupted.

    2. Select the following options:
	     - Stage or Publish products
        - Select specific products
        - _your product_
 
    3. Click **Publish**.

To test that the publish worked, complete the following steps:

1. Ensure that the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} app is
running.

2. Open a browser window and navigate to the API URL.
   The application is secure with client validation. If you donâ€™t supply the correct client certificate, it will error out (this is expected).

3. Navigate to the exposed {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}
URL.
   For example:
```
https://<domain>/<IBM_Cloud_org>-<IBM_Cloud_space>/<Catalog_identifier>/api/notes
```
A 200 response is displayed.

## Configuring a Catalog
{: #config_cat-managing_apis}

You can create and configure your API Manager Catalogs. Catalogs are useful for separating Products and APIs for testing before you make them available to Developer organizations. When you configure a Catalog, you can also configure custom branding so that you do not have to use the default API URL provided by the API Manager.

Complete the following steps to create your Catalog:

1. Click ![Navigate icon](images/navigate_to_icon.png "Navigate icon") > **Dashboard**.

2. Click **+ Add** > **Catalog **.
   The **Add Catalog** window is displayed.

3. Enter the name of your new Catalog in the **Display Name** field.

4. Enter the text that you want to form the Catalog segment of the URL, in the
   **Name** field.

   The **Name** field can contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z and 0-9), or a hyphen (-). A hyphen cannot be used as the first or last character in the name.

5. Click **Add**. Your Catalog is created, and is displayed on your dashboard.

6. To configure the Catalog, click the name of the Catalog, then click **Settings** > **Info**, and proceed with the following steps:
   1. If the new Catalog is a development Catalog, select **Development mode**.
      
	 If you select the development mode, staging and publishing actions are forced, meaning that if you republish a previously published Product it is overwritten without warning. If conflicts are found, they are automatically resolved by the system. Unpublish actions happen automatically. **
	 
	 Approval boxes are not displayed for development Catalogs. You cannot enable the approval process for lifecycles.

   2. If you want to enable automatic subscription for the Catalog, select **Automatic subscription**.
      Enabling automatic subscription makes testing of your APIs easier because a test application is used, with a pre-supplied client ID and client secret, which is automatically subscribed to all the Plans in the Catalog, so you don't have to specify a plan or application when testing.
	  
	  Automatic subscription is available only for a development Catalog.
	  
   3. If the Catalog is the default staging Catalog, select **Default**. 
      Calls to APIs that are published to the Catalog can use a shorter URL that does not include the Catalog name .

      You can only select **Default** for one Catalog.
	  
   4. **Optional**: Click **Endpoints**, and populate the following fields:
      - **Custom Gateway URL**: In the Custom Gateway URL text field, enter a URL. You use the Custom Gateway URL if you want to achieve custom branding of URLs for APIs that are deployed to {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}, rather than using the default URL that API Manager generates. By default, the {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}} gateway URL has the following format:
        ```
        https://gateway_cluster_hostname/organization_name/Catalog_name
        ```
         You can override the default by specifying a URL that is more appropriate for your enterprise; for example, `https://api.mycompany.com`. Any API endpoints that are displayed in the Developer Portal reflect the specified URL.
	  
         **Notes:**
         - You must configure a DNS entry that maps your custom host name and domain to the default gateway URL.
	     - For the endpoints of an API to reflect your custom gateway URL, you must configure the API to be enforced by the API Connect gateway. For more information, see [Specifying an alternative host for an API](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFS6T/com.ibm.apic.toolkit.doc/task_apionprem_creating_apis.html#task_tq2_11r_xt__enforce_step){: external}.
      - Ensure that the same custom gateway URL is not applied to multiple Catalogs as the behavior in that scenario is undefined.
	   - When you call the API, you can also set the HTTP host header on the API request to the value that you specified in the Custom Gateway URL field.

      - **Custom API URL**
	    In the Custom API URL text field, enter the URL. You use the Custom API URL to specify the URL for APIs that are deployed to a third party gateway.

	    The Custom API URL represents the endpoint by which the API is known externally; that is, the endpoint that is published to the developer portal and used by an application developer to invoke or advertise the API.

	    If you are using a third party gateway or external load balancer in this Catalog, supply the URL in this field. Any API endpoints that are displayed in the developer portal will then reflect the specified URL. These endpoints exist on the third party gateway or load balancer and project a virtual address, exposed to API consumers, that is mapped to the API proxy or API assembly endpoints on the gateway. The endpoints that are derived from the custom API URL are typically published in production developer portals to advertise the address of the API. 

        If you specify a custom API URL for a Catalog, it takes precedence over any host name that you specify when you configure the API. For more information, see [Specifying an alternative host for an API](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFS6T/com.ibm.apic.toolkit.doc/task_apionprem_creating_apis.html#task_tq2_11r_xt__enforce_step){: external}.

      - **Hostname for Developer Portal API Calls**:
	    In the Port API Endpoint window area, enter a host name for Developer Portal API calls. The host name that you enter can be the host name of your Management service. To access the Developer Portal API within the context of a Developer Portal, you must configure the base host name for the Developer Portal API calls. This action allows API Manager to map your host name to the provider organization and Catalog of the Developer Portal API calls instead of requiring you to look it up and include them in your calls.

7. Click the **Save** icon.

## Partitioning a Catalog
{: #part_cat-managing_apis}

To use the syndication feature in {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}, you must enable Spaces in any
Catalog in which you require syndication capabilities.

To enable Spaces in a Catalog, complete the following steps:
1. On the Dashboard of the API Manager UI, select the Catalog that you want to work with.

2. Click **Settings** > **Overview**, and click the **Spaces** slider control.

3. In the **Enable Spaces** window, click **Enable**, then click ![Save icon](images/icon_save.png "Save icon").
   A **Manage spaces** link is displayed beneath the **Spaces** slider control, and a **Spaces** link is added to the navigation list. You can manage your Spaces by clicking either of these links.

   Spaces are enabled for your Catalog, and a default Space, called New Space is created.

For more information about using syndication, see the Knowledge Center topics, [Using syndication in IBM API Connect](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFS6T/com.ibm.apic.apionprem.doc/capic_syndication_using.html){: external}.

## Configuring a Developer Portal
{: #config_dev_portal-managing_apis}

A Developer Portal is the place where your plans are published for application developers
to access and use.

You can build a customized Developer Portal for application developers to use. You have full
administrative control over appearance, content, user settings, and configuration settings.

In addition to allowing application developers to find and use APIs, the Developer Portal
provides more features such as forums, blogs, comments, ratings, and an OpenAPI UI for APIs.

1. In the API Manager UI, select the Catalog that you want to work with.

2. Select the **Settings** tab.

3. Click **Portal**.

4. In the **Portal Configuration** section, select **IBM Developer Portal**. The Portal URL is displayed.

5. Click **Save**. You are sent an email that contains a one-time login link for the Developer Portal web admin user.

6. Click the link that is sent in the email and follow the instructions to reset your password.

Your Developer Portal is configured. You can find the URL for the Developer Portal in the subject line of the email that you received. You can also find the URL in the API Manager UI by clicking **Portal** > **Settings**.

For more information about the tasks that you can complete in the Developer Portal, see the IBM
Knowledge Center topics about the [Developer Portal](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFS6T/com.ibm.apic.devportal.doc/capim_devportal_overview.html){: external}.

## Configuring permissions for roles
{: #config_permissions_roles-managing_apis}

To configure the Permissions for the roles in API Manager, complete the following
steps.

1. In the API Manager **Dashboard**, click the Catalog that you want to work with.

2. Click **Settings** > **Permissions**.
   The Product management permissions to which you can assign roles are displayed:
   - **Stage**: Allow staging of Products to the Catalog.
   - **View**: Allow viewing and listing of Products in the Catalog.
   - **Manage**: Allow management of Product lifecycle (publishing, deprecating, retiring and archiving).
   - **Approve**: Enable approvals for Product lifecycle state changes.

   Approval for Product lifecycle state changes is disabled for all development Catalogs.

3. To add a Role to the **Stage**, **View** or **Manage** permissions, click the corresponding **+** icon.
   The following list shows the default available roles:
   - Administrator
   - Product Manager
   - API Developer
   - Publisher

   The Owner role has all permissions.

4. Enable approvals for Product lifecycle state changes by selecting the required check boxes, then clicking the corresponding **+** icon to assign the roles that have permission to approve a lifecycle state change.

   The lifecycle state changes that you select are those for which you want to enforce approval. For example, if you select Publish but leave the others cleared, approval is required when anyone attempts to publish a Product, but no approval is required for any of the other lifecycle state changes.
   
5. To assign the roles that have permission to manage user-defined policies, click the **+** icon in the **Policy Management** section.
   The policy management permissions are displayed, enabling you to assign roles as required.
   
6. Click the **Save** icon.
